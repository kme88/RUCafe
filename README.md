# RUCafe

This project simulates a café that sells coffee and donuts. 
Using Graphical User Interfaces implemented with JavaFX, users can interact with the system to perform various tasks that are common for a café.
The project supports users' adding and removing of donuts or coffee for an order, customizing coffee items, cancelling orders, 
and exporting the store's orders.
All potential errors have been handled, and the program should alert the user in the event of such an error.
